# ExecPlan: Clanker9000 (Clanker) SDK-first Discord bot v1 implementation — updated with real network smoke/e2e, discord.py, and voice ingest research



## Research Tasks (run in parallel)

Task: Project / Repo Conventions

* Goal: detect repo layout, Python version, uv/pytest/ruff/mypy conventions, CI commands, where scripts live
* Output: conventions list to apply across SDK/bot/tests/scripts

Task: Reference Bot Code (Sparky + others)

* Goal: ingest provided reference code for “working-but-outdated” patterns (especially meme/shitpost prompts and bot wiring)
* Output: list of files/patterns to port + list of patterns to avoid/update (API changes, outdated discord.py idioms)

Task: discord.py Library Usage (commands + voice)

* Goal: confirm the correct modern way to implement slash commands, threads, attachments, and voice connect/disconnect in discord.py; identify official guidance and pitfalls
* Output: “discord.py usage checklist” applied to host layer (permissions/intents, command registration, voice lifecycle)
* Sources to start: Rapptz/discord.py repo; known limitations around voice receive APIs (discord.py historically emphasizes send more than receive). ([GitHub][1])

Task: dpytest Library Usage

* Goal: confirm how to structure tests, fixtures, and client setup for discord.py bots; identify supported surface area and gaps
* Output: recommended dpytest test harness + how to isolate Discord adapter code for testability ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])

Task: OpenAI Network Smoke/E2E Testing

* Goal: define “real network” tests for (1) LLM generation and (2) STT transcription that are stable, cheap, and safe (small prompts, tiny audio fixtures), and gated behind env vars
* Output: test plan + fixtures + CI strategy (“unit-only by default; smoke tests opt-in”) ([OpenAI Platform][3])

Task: Voice Ingest Pipeline (Opus → PCM, VAD, chunking, multi-speaker transcript)

* Goal: research the correct approach to handle Discord VC audio streams: Opus decoding, per-user buffers, resampling, VAD, chunk boundaries, overlap, diarization strategy (by user_id), and combining into a single transcript timeline
* Output: concrete pipeline spec + parameters (frame size, VAD thresholds, chunk sizes) + recommended libs (opus/ffmpeg/silero) ([GitHub][4])

---

## 1. Purpose & Outcome

* Build v1 of **Clanker9000**: SDK-first library (`clanker/`) + thin discord.py host (`clanker_bot/`).
* Provide provider adapters (LLM/STT/TTS/Image) with **one configured provider per capability**, no fallback chains.
* Add **two tiers of validation**:

  1. **Offline unit/integration tests**: fakes + dpytest, deterministic, CI-safe. ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])
  2. **Real network smoke/e2e tests**: OpenAI LLM + OpenAI STT transcription hitting real endpoints with tiny inputs, gated behind env vars and marked separately.
* Definition of done (additions):

  * Smoke tests exist for: “LLM generation returns non-empty content” and “STT transcription returns expected substring from a short fixture”
  * Smoke tests are opt-in (skipped unless env vars present), and have timeouts/retries/backoff

---

## 2. Context & Assumptions

* Use **discord.py** as the bot framework (Rapptz/discord.py). (User-provided link.)
* Testing: `pytest` + `dpytest` for Discord behavior coverage. ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])
* “Real network” tests must not run by default without credentials.
* Required tools/deps must be installed when needed:

  * Voice send/encode/decode commonly requires Opus available; ffmpeg often needed for audio conversion pipelines (install as part of dev and/or container setup).
* Scratch scripts are explicitly encouraged for validating approaches (audio chunking, VAD tuning, provider call shapes) prior to “final” implementation.

---

## 3. High-Level Approach

* Keep SDK pure and testable: domain models + provider Protocols + use-cases (respond, shitposts, voice pipeline logic) remain independent of discord.py and network.
* Host uses discord.py for commands and voice lifecycle; it injects configured providers into SDK.
* Testing strategy:

  * Unit tests for SDK and adapters (with fakes/mocks of HTTP client).
  * dpytest tests for command wiring and UX.
  * Separate smoke suite (`pytest -m network`) that makes real OpenAI calls when env vars are present.
* Voice ingest approach (research-first):

  * Treat “voice receive” as a dedicated spike/research item due to discord.py limitations/volatility historically around voice receive. ([GitHub][1])
  * Implement a pipeline that can accept either (a) decoded PCM frames or (b) “abstract audio frames” so Discord-specific acquisition can be swapped without contaminating core logic.

Rejected approaches:

1. “Run network tests in normal CI” — rejected; they should be opt-in or on a protected/nightly job due to flakiness/cost/secrets.
2. “Immediate full multi-user diarization model” — rejected for v1; use per-user speaker_id labeling (Discord user_id) and combine timeline deterministically.

TDD stance: Red → Green → Refactor per step; research spikes precede external-framework integration steps.

## 4. Work Plan (Runnable Steps)

### Step 1: RED — project skeleton + test markers

* Files:

  * `pyproject.toml` (deps, pytest markers `network`, `slow`)
  * `tests/conftest.py` (event loop, common fixtures)
  * `tests/test_sanity.py`
* Commands:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`
* Expected:

  * Baseline suite passes
* Recovery:

  * Fix `src/` layout packaging; ensure pytest-asyncio config matches project.

### Step 2: GREEN — core dataclasses + serialization

* Implement `Message`, `Persona`, `Context` (frozen dataclasses) + schema-versioned JSON mapping.
* Tests:

  * immutability, round-trip, schema_version required
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

### Step 3: RED — ProviderFactory + env var validation (including OpenAI-esque providers)

* Implement Protocols + ProviderFactory + explicit config mapping (`llm=openai`, `stt=whisper_api`, `tts=elevenlabs`).
* Add env var checks (unit-tested):

  * OpenAI LLM selected → require `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  * OpenAI STT selected → require `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  * ElevenLabs selected → require `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
* Tests:

  * Factory raises clear, actionable errors when env missing.
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

### Step 4: RESEARCH + SPIKE — discord.py command framework + dpytest harness

* Output artifacts (checked in):

  * `scratch/discordpy_slash_command_spike.py` (minimal bot registering `/chat`)
  * `scratch/dpytest_spike_test.py` (minimal test showing how to invoke the command)
  * `docs/discordpy_notes.md` (what to do, what not to do)
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q` (should still pass; spikes can be excluded from pytest collection)
* Apply findings from dpytest docs in the eventual test harness. ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])

### Step 5: GREEN — implement OpenAI adapters + OFFLINE tests (no network)

* Implement `OpenAI LLM` + `OpenAI STT` adapters with dependency injection (HTTP client or SDK client injected).
* Unit tests:

  * request-shape construction (mock client), timeouts set, errors classified (transient vs permanent)
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

### Step 6: NEW — REAL network smoke tests for OpenAI LLM + STT (opt-in)

* Add tests under `tests/network/` and mark with `@pytest.mark.network`:

  * `test_openai_llm_smoke_generates_text()`: small prompt, assert non-empty + contains expected token class (not exact text).
  * `test_openai_stt_smoke_transcribes_fixture()`: tiny WAV fixture, assert transcription contains a known substring.
* Gating:

  * If `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set → `pytest.skip`
  * Use strict timeouts; at most 1 retry on known transient errors.
* Commands:

  * Default (no secrets): `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`
  * Opt-in: `uv run --with pytest pytest -q -m network`
* Reference: OpenAI speech-to-text endpoints and supported models. ([OpenAI Platform][3])

### Step 7: GREEN — `respond()` use-case + replay log persistence

* Implement `respond(context, llm, policy, tts)` and replay log writer (JSONL schema versioned).
* Tests:

  * policy called, llm called with messages, optional tts used, replay log records written (sanitized)
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

### Step 8: RESEARCH + SPIKE — voice ingest pipeline: Opus/PCM/VAD/chunking/multi-user merge

* Add explicit research deliverables:

  * `docs/voice_ingest_pipeline.md` describing:

    * Discord voice acquisition approach in discord.py (or constraints/workarounds)
    * Opus decoding strategy, expected sample rate/channels
    * VAD strategy (Silero VAD): frame sizes, thresholds, padding, turn detection
    * Chunking rules (2–6s, overlap 200–500ms) and per-user buffers
    * How to merge transcripts into a single “meeting transcript” stream while preserving speaker_id=user_id and time ordering
  * `scratch/voice_pipeline_spike.py`:

    * takes a WAV, runs VAD + chunker, prints chunk boundaries, calls STT (optionally network-gated)
* Ensure required tools are installed where needed:

  * Document/install: Opus + ffmpeg (and any Python deps for Silero VAD).
* Sources: Silero VAD repo + general guidance on frame-based VAD. ([GitHub][4])

### Step 9: GREEN — implement voice pipeline (SDK) with deterministic tests

* Implement in `clanker/voice/`:

  * `vad.py` (Silero wrapper)
  * `chunker.py` (2–6s chunks with overlap)
  * `worker.py` (`transcript_loop_once()` consuming per-user PCM buffers)
* Tests:

  * Use audio fixtures: verify chunk boundaries, overlap, and that emitted transcript events include speaker_id and audio_chunk_id
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

### Step 10: GREEN — discord.py host wiring for commands (dpytest)

* Implement:

  * `/chat`, `/speak`, `/shitpost`, `/join`, `/leave`
  * Thread creation + attachments according to discord.py best practices (from research)
* Tests (dpytest):

  * verify messages posted, attachments present, BUSY behavior enforced
* Command:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q` ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])

### Step 11: NEW — real network “bot-level” smoke script (manual / one-off)

* Add `scripts/smoke_discord_openai.py` (not a pytest test):

  * Connect to a test guild/channel
  * Run a minimal `/chat` flow and log end-to-end latency
  * Optionally run a short voice transcription path if voice receive is viable
* Gating:

  * Requires `DISCORD_TOKEN` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`; fails fast with clear messages.
* This satisfies “one-off scripts validating capabilities” without destabilizing CI.

### Step 12: Health endpoint + tool installation integration

* Implement `/status` returning `{uptime, active_voice, version}` with tests.
* Add install docs / container config for native deps (Opus, ffmpeg) and verify they’re present at runtime when voice features enabled.
* Commands:

  * `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`

---

## 5. Parallelizable Tasks

* Reference bot code ingestion (Sparky prompts) can run in parallel with SDK dataclasses and respond().
* OpenAI adapter offline work (Step 5) can run in parallel with discord.py research spike (Step 4).
* Voice pipeline research spike (Step 8) can run in parallel with host command wiring (Step 10), but **voice receive constraints must be resolved before** committing to a “real VC transcript” deliverable.

---

## 6. Scratch / Exploration Area

Create `scratch/` (checked in, excluded from pytest collection):

* `scratch/discordpy_slash_command_spike.py` (minimal slash command bot)
* `scratch/dpytest_spike_test.py` (minimal dpytest example)
* `scratch/voice_pipeline_spike.py` (VAD + chunking + optional STT)
* `scratch/provider_smoke_openai.py` (direct OpenAI LLM + STT calls, tiny inputs)

Add `scratch/learning_log.md` to record:

* discord.py gotchas (intents, permissions, command sync)
* dpytest limitations and how tests were structured around them
* voice ingestion design decisions

---

## 7. Validation & Acceptance

Test matrix:

* Unit (default CI):

  * models/serialization, ProviderFactory env validation, respond(), replay log
  * VAD/chunking/worker logic with fixtures (no network)
* Integration (default CI):

  * dpytest command tests for `/chat`, `/speak`, `/shitpost`, `/join`, `/leave` ([dpytest.readthedocs.io][2])
* Network smoke (opt-in):

  * `pytest -m network` for OpenAI LLM + OpenAI STT (tiny, stable inputs) ([OpenAI Platform][3])
* Manual smoke:

  * `scripts/smoke_discord_openai.py` for full end-to-end validation in a test guild

Commands:

* Default: `uv run --with pytest pytest -q`
* Network: `uv run --with pytest pytest -q -m network`

PASS looks like:

* Default suite passes with no secrets
* Network suite passes when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (and is skipped otherwise)
* Voice pipeline unit tests pass deterministically
* Bot host adheres to discord.py best practices captured in `docs/discordpy_notes.md`
