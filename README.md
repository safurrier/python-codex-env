# Python Project Template

A modern Python project template with best practices for development and collaboration.

## Features
- 🚀 Fast dependency management with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- ✨ Code formatting with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- 🔍 Type checking with [ty](https://astral.sh/blog/ty)
- 🧪 Testing with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
- 🐳 Docker support for development and deployment
- 👷 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- 🤖 Automated documentation assistant powered by the Claude Agent SDK

## Python Version
This template requires Python 3.9 or higher and defaults to Python 3.12. To use a different version:

```bash
# List available Python versions
uv python list

# Use a specific version (e.g., 3.11)
make setup PYTHON_VERSION=3.11  # or UV_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11 make setup

# View installed Python versions
uv python list --installed
```

uv will automatically download and manage Python versions as needed.

## Quickstart
```bash
# Clone this repo and change directory
git clone git@github.com:safurrier/python-collab-template.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name

# Initialize a new project
make init

# Follow the prompts to configure your project
```

This will:
- Configure project metadata (name, description, author)
- Handle example code (keep, simplify, or remove)
- Initialize a fresh git repository
- Set up development environment
- Configure pre-commit hooks (optional, enabled by default)

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run these checks before each commit:
- Type checking (ty)
- Linting (ruff)
- Formatting (ruff)
- Tests (pytest)

Alternatively, you can set up manually:
```bash
# Install dependencies and set up the environment
make setup

# Run the suite of tests and checks
make check

# Optional: Remove example code to start fresh
make clean-example
```

## Development Commands

### Quality Checks
```bash
make check      # Run all checks (test, ty, lint, format)
make test       # Run tests with coverage
make ty         # Run type checking
make lint       # Run linter
make format     # Run code formatter
```

### Local CI Testing

Run GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Run full test suite locally (auto-installs act if needed)
make ci-local

# List available workflows
make ci-list

# Run specific job
JOB=checks make ci-local

# Run documentation build check
make ci-local-docs

# Fast debugging (customize .github/workflows/ci-debug.yml)
make ci-debug

# Clean up act containers
make ci-clean
```

**Note:** The first run will automatically install `act` if it's not present.

**Benefits:**
- 5-20 second feedback vs. 2-5 minutes on GitHub
- Test before commit/push
- No GitHub Actions minutes consumed
- Debug workflows locally

**Troubleshooting:**

*Linux: Docker permissions*
```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
# Or run: newgrp docker

# Verify it works
docker ps
```

*macOS: Colima disk lock errors*
```bash
# If you get "disk in use" or similar errors:
colima stop
colima delete
colima start
```

*General: Stale act containers*
```bash
# Clean up old containers and images
make ci-clean
```

### Example Code
The repository includes a simple example showing:
- Type hints
- Dataclasses
- Unit tests
- Modern Python practices

To remove the example code and start fresh:
```bash
make clean-example
```
## Container Support (Docker/Podman)

### Development Environment

The project automatically detects and uses either Docker or Podman:

```bash
make dev-env    # Uses podman if available, otherwise docker

# Or explicitly choose:
CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker make dev-env
CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman make dev-env

# Check which engine will be used:
make container-info
```

This creates a container with:
- All dependencies installed
- Source code mounted (changes reflect immediately)
- Development tools ready to use
- Automatic UID/GID mapping for file permissions

### Production Image
```bash
make build-image    # Build production image
make push-image     # Push to container registry
```

# Auto-docs bot

This template now ships with an opinionated documentation automation flow that can be
installed as a GitHub App. When the app is installed on a repository:

1. Label a pull request with `docs:auto` to enable automation hints.
2. Comment with `/docs quickstart`, `/docs update`, or `/docs deep-update` (optionally
   including notes) to trigger the assistant.
3. The bot reacts with 👀, spawns a Claude Agent SDK worker to explore the repository,
   generates documentation patches via BAML, and pushes a new branch prefixed with
   `auto-docs/`.
4. A companion pull request is opened against the original base branch, the comment gets
   a 🎉 reaction, and a link to the documentation PR is posted.

The implementation lives under `src/auto_docs_bot/` and is intentionally light on
configuration—behaviour is driven solely by environment variables such as
`GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`, `CLAUDE_API_KEY`, and `BAML_ENV`.
